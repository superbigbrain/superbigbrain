<li>Knowledge is only useful if it&rsquo;s transferable.</li>
<li>Being able to explain things clearly and simply is a sign of knowledge.</li>
<li>Recall-based methods of learning tend to be more effective than the
alternative.
<ul>
<li>What is the alternative?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are different levels of knowledge. Surface-level knowledge is common.
Deep knowledge is rare. In between surface-level and deep knowledge is a
spectrum.</li>
<li>Deep knowledge can not be obtained through words alone. You must actively
apply the knowledge you&rsquo;re looking for.</li>

<li>Can Anki improve my recall speed?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is syntopic reading?
<ul>
<li>Compile a list of sources</li>
<li>Come up with a list of questions the authors need to answer</li>
<li>Create a personal terminology that can be used to normalize the terminology
in different sources</li>
<li>Understand the key ideas and arguments of each source</li>
<li>Comparison of different authors&rsquo; viewpoints.</li>
<li>Survey of the field.</li>
<li>Identify themes of the field.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mindmapping seems like it would be useful, but I don&rsquo;t see where it fits in.</li>
<li>I find self Q &amp; A really useful. If I have a hard time answering a question,
then I don&rsquo;t fully understand something.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Who goes back for more after solving a problem? That&rsquo;s crazy.</li>
<li>That said, I can see how this would help a lot.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Intelligent people simply aren&rsquo;t willing to accept answers they don&rsquo;t
understand.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Intelligence is partially a function of &ldquo;hardware&rdquo; traits such as raw
intellect, but it&rsquo;s also partially a function of &ldquo;software&rdquo; traits like the
sum of your intellectual habits. Intellectual habits can be learned and
internalized.</li>
<li>Being able to generate concrete examples of the thing you&rsquo;re trying to
understand can be really useful.</li>
<li>Think about things and questions for yourself before looking for an answer.</li>
<li>Come up with a list of questions you want answers to and pick sources that
answer those questions.</li>
<li>Things to ask:
<ul>
<li>Bug what exactly <em>is</em> X? What <em>is</em> it?</li>
<li>Why <em>must</em> X be true? Why does this <em>have</em> to be the case? What is the
single, fundamental reason?</li>
<li>Do I really believe that this is true, deep down? Would I bet a large amount
of money on it with a friend?</li>
</ul>

<li>Parable from <em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em>.</li>
<li>Look into John Boyd and has work on tacit knowledge</li>

<p>Quotes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are not entitled to have a view or an opinion of your own, unless you can
argue better against that view than the smartest guy who holds the opposite
view.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad to have an opinion you&rsquo;re proud of if you can&rsquo;t state the arguments
for the other side better than your opponents.</p>
<p>— Charlie Munger</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You have to figure out what your own aptitudes are. If you play games where
other people have the aptitudes and you don’t, you’re going to lose. And
that’s as close to certain as any prediction that you can make. You have to
figure out where you’ve got an edge. And you’ve got to play within your own
circle of competence.</p>
<p>If you want to be the best tennis player in the world, you may start out
trying and soon find out that it’s hopeless—that other people blow right by
you. However, if you want to become the best plumbing contractor in Bemidji,
that is probably doable by two-thirds of you. It takes a will. It takes the
intelligence. But after a while, you’d gradually know all about the plumbing
business in Bemidji and master the art. That is an attainable objective, given
enough discipline. And people who could never win a chess tournament or stand
in center court in a respectable tennis tournament can rise quite high in life
by slowly developing a circle of competence—which results partly from what
they were born with and partly from what they slowly develop through work.</p>
<p>— Charlie Munger</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and
knowing something.</p>
<p>— Richard Feynman</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The three outstanding problems in physics, in a certain sense, were never
worked on while I was at Bell Labs… We didn’t work on (1) time travel, (2)
teleportation, and (3) antigravity. They are not important problems because we
do not have an attack. It’s not the consequence that makes a problem
important, it is that you have a reasonable attack.</p>

<li>Learning the AlphaGo paper:
<ul>
<li>Start by skimming the paper looking for two things:

<li>Each time you should understand a little bit more.</li>
<li>Author did 5-6 such passes.</li>
<li>The goal is to build background understanding.</li>
<li>If something is unclear, move on. Come back later.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Attempt a thorough read
<ul>
<li>Purpose is to understand in detail</li>
<li>Repeat as needed

<li>Anki questions should be getting higher level by now</li>

</li>
<li>Knowledge exists in plateaus.
<ul>
<li>First you&rsquo;ll achieve shallow knowledge.</li>
<li>Eventually you&rsquo;ll achieve deep knowledge.</li>

</li>
<li>Background research is a specific type of learning?
<ul>
<li>Context development?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s also a sense in which it&rsquo;s possible to use Anki not just to read
papers, but to “read” the entire research literature of some field or
subfield.&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>Read the best 5-10 papers in the field.</li>
<li>Do shallower reads of a larger number of less important (though still good)
papers.</li>
<li>Identify what&rsquo;s been done and what hasn&rsquo;t been done, open problems,
questions I&rsquo;d like answers to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Questions and answers in Anki should be atomic.</li>
<li>Break things up into atomic facts.</li>
<li>Build rich hierarchies of interconnections and integrative questions.</li>
<li>TL;DR Put atomic questions in Anki. Reveiew them.</li>
<li>Nearly everything can be Anki-ified.</li>
<li>What does a good system for note-taking look like?
<ul>
<li>How do Anki and note-taking work together?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Avoid the yes/no pattern.
<ul>
<li>There are other questions that require more thinking and thus are better
suited for developing deep knowledge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Memory and memorization aren&rsquo;t bad. They&rsquo;re the foundation of knowledge. They
are required, but insufficient on their own.
<ul>
<li>Anki is a memory tool for helping you learn the basics of a field.</li>

<li>Chunking?

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;How do I know when a post is done? I write until I stop having significant
questions, until my imaginary audience stop raising their hands. The end
result is that writing forces me to acknowledge and then work through my
confusion.&rdquo;</li>
<li>There is some connection between the confidence you feel about a given topic
and how well you really understand that topic. Conversely, if you don&rsquo;t feel
deeply confident about your knowledge, then your knowledge isn&rsquo;t very deep.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Intentionally and systematically build my knowledge base by understanding
ideas, working through proofs, and implementing models.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Systematically working through background material was a turning point in the
author&rsquo;s PhD.</li>
<li>&ldquo;If my current project were to fail, the directed and intentional process of
systematically attacking the background material will have prepared me well
for the next problem.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Working on important, attackable problems requires deep background knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/learning/">How to remember what you learn</a></p>
<ul>
<li>A &ldquo;mind dump&rdquo; file seems useful. If something unrelated to your work creeps
into your mind, get it out by flushing it to the mind dump. You can always
review the mind dump later.</li>
<li>Author writes out his thoughts as he reads.
<ul>
<li>E.g. &ldquo;So Peter explains that there are four characteristics of a monopoly,
but I don’t really understand why branding is one of them; why so?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you don&rsquo;t understand something, break it down into a set of simple
questions. Another article referred to these as &ldquo;atomic&rdquo; questions and
suggested putting them in Anki. I think it was the &ldquo;Augmenting Long-term
Memory&rdquo; article.</li>
<li>After you&rsquo;re done with a session, take a few minutes to summarize what you&rsquo;ve
learned in your own words without referencing the sources or your notes.
<ul>
<li>Identify the key ideas of your sources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Recall might be a skill that can be trained. Try it out and see if you get
better?</li>
<li>Mixed practice vs blocked practice
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Mixed practice means putting exercises at the end of the book, not at the
end of the chapter.&rdquo;</li>
<li>This requires a lot more mental energy that answering questions that are
definitely about what you just read.</li>
<li>The results of mixed practice are impressive: +50%.
<ul>
<li>Cite?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mastery is related to pattern matching. Pattern matching is important.</li>
<li>Make your learning habits time-based instead of goal-based.
<ul>
<li>Goal-based approaches lead to the wrong incentives and incorrect
gamification.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>I should have a strategy or system for reading.</li>
<li>&ldquo;To get the most out of each book we read it is vital to have a plan for
recording, reflecting on, and putting into action the conclusions we draw from
the information we consume.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t read stuff we find boring.</li>
<li>Finishing the book is optional.</li>
<li>Choose sources that:
<ul>
<li>Stand the test of time</li>
<li>Are interesting to you</li>
<li>Are relevant to your current situation</li>
<li>Answer the questions you want answers to</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chapter summaries are a good idea.
<ul>
<li>Write them as soon as you finish the chapter.</li>
<li>Re-read the previous two summaries before starting the next chapter.</li>
<li>After finishing the book, re-write the summaries for each chapter from
memory. Then summarize the entire book.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://fs.blog/how-to-read-a-book/">How to Read a Book</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Systematic skimming:
<ol>
<li>Read the preface.</li>
<li>Study the table of contents.</li>
<li>Check the index.</li>
<li>Read the inside jacket.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>This should give you enough information to understand the book and decide
whether it deserves more of your time and attention.</li>

<h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>
<h4 id="background-knowledge">Background Knowledge</h4>
<p>Also, <em>basic</em>, <em>foundational</em>, <em>fundamental</em>, or <em>required knowledge</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every field has a set of knowledge that is considered table stakes. Knowing
this stuff does not make you an expert, but not knowing it means you&rsquo;re
certainly not an expert.</p>
<p>By way of example, the inverted index data structure is considered background
or foundational knowledge in the information retrieval field. Inverted indexes
are so common and so fundamental to the field that you can&rsquo;t be considered an
expert without understanding them.</p>
<p>When learning a new field, your primary goal should be to establish strong
background knowledge on the field. It&rsquo;s important that you have strong
foundational knowledge if your goal is to eventually do important work.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="q--a">Q &amp; A</h3>
<p>I want to become an expert on information retrieval and natural language
processing. How do I do that?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Information retrieval and natural language processing are both huge fields.
Each one has a set of foundational or background knowledge that is required to
be considered an &ldquo;expert&rdquo;. Your job is to discover and learn that background
knowledge. You will know you&rsquo;re successful when you can have an intelligent
conversation about the state of information retrieval and natural language
processing with someone who is a recognized expert.</p>
<p>See <a href="#background-knowledge">Background Knowledge</a> for more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How does one acquire background knowledge?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good question!</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, let&rsquo;s assume that the knowledge you want to
pick up already exists. Your job is to find it. That means identifying useful
source materials such as papers and books.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What makes a source useful?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, that really depends on what your goal is. For now, let&rsquo;s say that our
goal is to know the names of things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why is our goal to know the names of things?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because you don&rsquo;t know anything right now and you don&rsquo;t know what you don&rsquo;t
know. Our first order of business is to grow the list of known-unknowns: the
set of things you know exist, but don&rsquo;t yet understand.</p>
<p>When you know the names of things, then you can ask questions about those
things. This is how we move things from unknown-unknown to known-unknown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK. What makes a source useful if our goal is to know the names of things?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What we&rsquo;re looking for is a broad overview of the field. Wikipedia is usually
a good place to start.</p>
<p>After Wikipedia, other places that should have relatively good diversity are
the <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love">Papers We Love</a>
Github repository and the most downloaded and cited papers from the relevant
<a href="https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups">ACM SIG</a>.</p>
<p>Each of these sources should reference other sources that might be useful. A
source if useful if it helps you grow your terminology with respect to the
field you&rsquo;re studying.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what artifacts should result from reading these sources?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One good artifact to have is a terminology document that explains the key
ideas and themes of the field at a high level. Anki cards are even better,
because spaced repition seems to be a good idea.</p>
<p>You should also have a list of questions that came to you while reading the
source material. These could be questions about things that weren&rsquo;t explained
well or things that weren&rsquo;t explained at all or anything else. Not all of
these questions will ultimately be relevant to building your background
knowledge, but it&rsquo;s good to err on the side of having too many questions than
too few.</p>

</ul>
<p>And what do I do after I have these things?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By the time you have the terminology down and a reasonable set of questions,
you should be competent enough to start tracking down answers to your
questions. Your hunt for answers will lead to more questions, and so you&rsquo;ll
gradually find yourself answering more and more advanced questions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How do I tell if I understand something?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write about it. Explain it to someone else. Writing is thinking and forces you
to clarify what you mean. Holes in your story become obvious when the story is
written down. Writing allows you the opportunity to synthesize all of the
knowledge you&rsquo;ve accumulated into some coherent and inherently useful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What else should I keep in mind?</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Force yourself to justify your beliefs. Why <em>must</em> this thing be true? What
exactly <em>is</em> this thing?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concrete examples are worth their weight in gold. Much time is lost to
abstract examples. Being concrete makes it easier to be simple, clear, and
consise and to avoid hand-waving over important implementation details.</p>
