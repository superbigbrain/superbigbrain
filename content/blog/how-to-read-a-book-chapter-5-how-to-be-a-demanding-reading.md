This will be a short one. _How to Be a Demanding Reader_ is a short chapter,
and I didn't find many insights. It felt more like "some final thoughts before
we talk about analytical reading" than anything else.

## Key Ideas

The _TL;DR_ of this chapter is that you will get the most out of a book when
you have a conversation with it. A common theme we keep coming back to is that
reading should generate questions, and your job is to find answers in the book,
and that theme is present in this chapter.

Having a mental conversation with the book isn't enough, though. You should be
writing down your questions and answers. Writing helps us clarify and organize
our thoughts, so your questions and answers should both be well-formed. Writing
things down will also give you an artifact you can refer back to later that is
more durable than your memory.

Finally, you must work on turning this into a habit. When you first start doing
this, it will slow down your reading speed a lot. As you get more used to the
process, it will become automatic, and you'll regain some of the reading speed
you lost.

## Importance

I don't have much to say here because these are ideas that we've talked about a
lot already. Ask the book questions and then answer them. Build a habit of
doing that. These two things will make your reading astoundingly effective.
You'll remember and understand more.

Chapter 6 is the first chapter in Part 2 of _How to Read a Book_. Part 2
focuses on analytical reading, which is the part I'm most interested in. Stay
tuned and check Twitter for updates.
