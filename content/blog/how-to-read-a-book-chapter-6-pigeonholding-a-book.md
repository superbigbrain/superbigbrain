## Key Ideas

The primary argument of Chapter 6 is that you have to know what kind of book
you're reading to get the most out of it. Adler recommends classifying the book
before you start reading. Is it fiction or non-fiction? Is it practical or
theoretical?

### Fiction vs. Non-Fiction Books

The idea here should be obvious. If you're reading for entertainment, then go
wild. Read whatever you want. But if you're reading to learn about politics or
science or history, it's important to understand whether you're reading
something true or something made up.

That's not to say that fiction doesn't have its place in teaching us about
politics or science or history, but we shouldn't take what we read in a
fictional book as fact.

### Practical vs. Theoretical Books

The key difference between "practical" and "theoretical," in this sense, is
summed up well in this quote:

> Theoretical books teach you _that_ something is the case. Practical books
> teach you _how_ to do something you want to do or think you should do.

For example, _How to Read a Book_ is a practical book. It tells you how to
intelligently read a book and gives you many actions you can take to do so. On
the other hand, The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin is theoretical. It lays
out Darwin's ideas about evolution and tells us what evolution is, but doesn't
tell us how to do evolution.

## Importance

I struggled with the importance of this chapter because there are really two
ideas:

* It's important to know what kind of book you're reading.
* Classifying the book will help you understand what kind of book you're reading.

I agree with the former wholeheartedly, but I think for a different reason than
the author does.

I'm afraid I have to disagree with the latter. Sure, you should know whether
you're reading fiction or non-fiction, but that's obvious. And while I find the
distinction between practical and theoretical books useful, I think it's far
less important than the author makes it out to be.

What's more important to me is that I have a list of questions that I want
answers to and determine whether the book will answer those questions. If the
book answers my questions, then I don't care what kind of book it is.

I also believe that good questions will replace Adler's classifications. A
question like "Who was the 44th president of the United States?" can only be
answered by a theoretical, non-fiction book. I'm using the "theoretical" and
"non-fiction" descriptions for consistency, but this works along any dimension.

That's why I agree that it's important to know what kind of book you're
reading. Specifically, you must know whether the book is the type of book that
can answer your questions.

## Takeaway

This chapter's takeaway is a simple one: knowing what kind of book you're
reading and whether the book has answers to your questions is critical.

A question I had before starting to read _How to Read a Book_ was, "How can I
read books more effectively?". Skimming through the book told me that Adler had
many suggestions on how to do that, so I knew there's a good chance the book
would answer my question.

Personally, I don't think classifying books is worthwhile. The only thing that
matters is that my questions are answered.

I'm interested in hearing other opinions on this. Do you disagree with my
takeaways? Am I just being pedantic? Hit me up on [Twitter][twitter], and let's
