A common theme in _How to Read a Book_ is understanding what a book is about.
Adler continues building on this theme in _X-Raying a Book_ by suggesting that
we summarize the book we're reading as briefly as possible and write our own
outline for the book. Adler's argument is that these tasks demonstrate your
understanding of the logical structure of the book, which is a prerequisite for
the reading skills that come later in _How to Read a Book_.

## Terminology

### Logical Structure vs. Physical Structure

I'll refer to a book's logical or physical structure several times in this
post, so I thought it would be a good idea to make sure we're on the same page
about what that means.

A book's _physical_ structure is the parts, chapters, and chapter sections.
Each piece of a books physical structure usually begins with a title and can be
found in the table of contents (although chapter sections may not be listed).

A book's _logical_ structure is the set of common themes, key ideas, arguments,
and supporting evidence that makes up the entire book. Often the logical
structure closely follows the physical structure, but not always. Sometimes an
argument begins in one chapter and is finished in another. Sometimes a common
theme is brought up in seemingly random places throughout the book.

In the same way that a book's physical structure is hierarchical — parts have
chapters and chapters have sections — so too is a book's logical structure.
Common themes are made up of a set of key ideas. Each key idea is made up of a
set of arguments, and each argument is backed up by one or more pieces of
supporting evidence.

## Key Ideas

### Summarize the Work

If you understand what you're reading, you should summarize it in a few
sentences. As an approximation, the more comfortable you find this task, the
better your understanding of the book.

Our goal is to understand the logical structure of the book. What arguments is
the author making? How are these arguments compiled into a set of key ideas?
Adler talks about finding the "unity," the single thread of plot that permeates
the entire work. This is what we want to identify and describe in our summary.

Another exercise you can try is summarizing the work at the different levels of
hierarchy. What is the book about as a whole? What is each common theme about?
What is each key idea about?

### Outline the Work

You may be able to guess the logical structure of a book, but that doesn't mean
you understand it. When you guess, you make assumptions, and assumptions often
turn out to be wrong. By explicitly outlining the book, you remove those
assumptions and focus on what the author is saying instead of what you
think the author is saying.

One way to outline a book looks like this:

* Common Theme
  * Key Idea 1
    * Argument 1
      * Evidence 1
      * Evidence 2
    * Argument 2
      * Evidence 1
      * Evidence 2
  * Key Idea 2
    * Argument 1
      * Evidence 1
      * Evidence 2
    * Argument 2
      * Evidence 1
      * Evidence 2

Repeat this structure for each common theme.

Outlining is immensely time-consuming, so the amount of detail in the outline
should be proportional to the book's importance and the value you expect
to get from it. If a book is more important or you think a more detailed
outline will yield more value, then go for it.  If the work is less important
or a simple outline will get you most of the value, then keep it simple.

Outlining naturally captures the different levels of hierarchy in a book, so no
additional exercise is needed on that front.

## Takeaway

I thought this chapter was great and full of fantastic advice.

Here's what I'm taking away:

* Understanding a book's logical structure is crucial because it allows you to
  see how the author build on their knowledge to arrive at a certain
  conclusion.
* The ability to summarize a book at different levels of hierarchy is a good
  approximation for how well you understand the book's logical structure.
* Writing your own outline of a book helps removes assumptions about what the
  author is saying and cements the logical structure of the book in your mind.
* The physical structure and logical structure of a book are not always the
  same. When reading for understanding, we care more about the logical
  structure.
* Writers must also be able to identify the unity and structure in their own
  work. If the writer of a book can't establish those two things, how can they
  expect readers to?

I'm always looking for second opinions on what I read. If you've got an
